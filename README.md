# Hello!

I'm Ivan Bogachev and in general I'm UI developer. I specialize in promotional websites, various experiments, CSS magic, SVG and WebGL animations.

My contacts:
 - [Personal website](https://sfi0zy.github.io/). It's like my personal twitter. I repost various interesting things I created there.
 - [Profile on CodePen](https://codepen.io/sfi0zy). I publish WebGL demos, CSS animations and examples for beginners.
 - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sfi0zy) and [Telegram](https://t.me/sfi0zy). They are the fastest ways to contact me.

And for Russian speakers:

 - [Profile on Habr Q&A](https://qna.habr.com/user/sfi0zy). It's like Russian StackOverflow, I answer questions about programming.
