# Hello!

I'm Ivan Bogachev and I'm UI developer.

I specialize in promotional websites, SVG and WebGL animations and interactive guides. Also, I'm an author and a mentor. I write articles about web animations and related topics and help beginner developers to understand how to use modern front-end tools.

My contacts:
 - [Personal website](https://sfi0zy.github.io/). It's like my personal twitter. I post various interesting things I created there.
 - [Profile on CodePen](https://codepen.io/sfi0zy). I publish WebGL demos, CSS animations and examples for beginners.
 - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sfi0zy) and [Telegram](https://t.me/sfi0zy). They are the fastest ways to contact me.

And for Russian speakers:
 - [Articles and tutorials on creative front-end development](https://habr.com/ru/users/sfi0zy/posts/). If you want to understand what I do - just check it out.
 - [Profile on Habr Q&A](https://qna.habr.com/user/sfi0zy). It's like Russian StackOverflow, I answer questions about programming.
 - [VK](https://vk.com/sfi0zy). Feel free to write me here too, I don't bite.
